Empire/Dynasty Backgrounds:

Gorvan Empire:
    The Gorvan Empire has waged wars throughout the history, mainly for land and resources. It's a prideful Empire
    that solely focuses on the military might and the prosperous mercenaries that help throughout the lands. The Gorvan
    Empire is mainly Humans with very little variations of races throughout. In some Cities and Towns the laws are
    strict, in others the laws are a little less enforced.

    War hasn't raged with the Gorvan Empire in over 50 years, and the Empire is itching towards war, but with who?

Land of Ice:
    Land of Snow and Ice only the few live in the midsts of cold dangers. Typically, they keep to themselves but at times
    they raid to the south in the Gorvan Empire for food and slaves. The Land of Ice is made up of Goliaths, Trolls,
    Giants, and other monsterous beasts the live in the cold depths.

    The Land of Ice has a vast mountain range along with deep snow valleys that can reach 25 feet high. Without the
    proper equipment or clothing, it's deadly for those to venture to far into the land of freezing

Twinland Empire:
    Sister Empire to the Gorvan Empire. Has been allies with the Gorvan Empire for many century's. The alliance is strong
    but there are talks that the alliance could be seeing cracks forming with enough nudge, could alter the alliance
    completely. There have been groups that have wanted to disrupt this alliance over the last century to inflict
    chaos and create a new Empire under new ruling, but have not yet succeeded.

    The growing tensions have caused citizens to be wary of outsiders and less trustworthy of them. Some however feel
    the outsiders are needed while others give a cold shoulder as they are unsure of the intentions of them. Majority
    of the Twinland Empire is Human with additional Halflings and Gnomes. Other races are welcomed but citizens keep a
    distance between them and are wary.

Land of Arial:
    Land of the Elves and Gnomes, though uncommon the Elves and the Gnomes work together quite well. The Gnomes mine
    the largest mountain behind the City of the Olsa Thalor while Elves barter with the Gnomes for what comes out of
    the Mine. There are other landscapes and mountains that contain other treasures and sometimes other things that live
    deep beneath the mountains...
    The land is for the most part peaceful and stays out of the politics of the outside Empires and Dynasty. It has been
    quite some time since the Land of Arial has gone to war however, they have an army that has seen many wars and are
    not new to battle.
    With the Gnomes mining and creating armor that the rest of the world has never seen, the Elven army is armed with
    some of the fiercest weapons and armor the current world has yet to see. There may come a time when the world will
    see what the Land of Arial has.

Land of Iron:
    A simple mining island that has found an Iron deposit that seems to never end. The Land of Iron is under the
    protection of the Twinland Empire as the island consists of miners and merchants looking to make enough money to
    retire in the farmlands of the Twinland Empire.
    The island is made up of various races, during the day its pure business but during the night the laws tend to be
    less enforced and gets rowdy from time to time. The mines are mainly Iron with a few gems here and there that
    merchants buy for and sell to travelers looking for unique gems.


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Land of Coal:
    Main island for Coal for the Empire states, not ruled by any main Empire faction but is protected by a mercenary
    group that have named themselves the Dark Candidates. They are always hiring additional mercenaries looking for work
    as well as hiring travelers to take care of monsters that live deep within the coal mine and pirates that linger
    around the island.
    The island is very well self-sufficient and creates a massive amount of income from the bartering of Coal to the
    Empire and secretly to the Dynasties that live to the East. They have a contract with the Empire states that the
    coal will only go to the Empire and that any coal going to the Dynasties will be an act of war.
    The Land of Coal is also a great place to find Smugglers who are very good at there trade and getting past armadas
    that may be patrolling the outskirts.

Triple Dead Islands:
    Triple Dead Islands used to thrive on the three islands and be incredibly wealthy. The only standing city is
    Volkrau, a city that is having the population leave in fear of what happened to the other two islands. Rumors have
    gone around that the other two islands started having the dead rise up from the ground and take over the islands.
    They sent forces to face the dead and each force that they sent, none came back. They abandoned the island to the
    South and the North. People within the city have heard that the dead is starting to rise on the main island now,
    as people hear this, they are jumping on ships and getting out of the city.
    The people that stay want to live on the island while others stay for the treasure that they've heard that lies
    to the North and South islands. There are some individuals on the island however think a Necromancer is the cause
    of the Dead rising up and taking over the Triple Islands. But, no one yet has offered to help to see what the
    cause actually is and if they can stop it or not.

Dwarven Island:
    The land of the Dwarves. The Island is mainly of Dwarves with a few outsiders that have gained the trust of the
    Dwarves. They tend to keep to their mine that lies deep beneath the Mountain. A very stubborn bunch of Dwarves that
    love the Gold that comes out of the mine. They have fought of Dragons who have tried to lay waste to the Dwarves,
    they have crafted armor and weapons that suit their needs.
    They are willing to trade and barter with outsiders, with giving tasks to travelers looking for a quick coin. They
    have heard rumors of a war starting to brew up and the weapon and armor manufacturing has kicked up tenfold to make
    sure they are ready for any kind of war that may come.
    The Dwarves are very good at playing drinking games during the night as well with Travelers trying to gain more coin
    than they currently have.


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Traders Cove:
    Traders Cove or what some may call the Mercenary hiring grounds for both Empire and the Dynasty. Others who know the
    origin of the Traders Cove know it as `Smugglers Paradise`. This is where things become lawless between the three
    islands and where most people will go to the highest bidder. Majority of the people that live on the islands don't
    have any allegiance so long they are getting paid.
    This is also the place to stop and get contraband from the Empire and Dynasty that Smugglers have acquired through
    various means. It may cost a little bit of money, but the there are ways to obtain the money to get the items wanted.


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Island of Secrets:
    Very few have ever gone to the Island of Secrets as the rumors tend to scare the majority of the population. For
    those that wish to travel to the island, they will find that the island is full of monsters and creatures that are
    both friendly and very hostile. But what lies beneath dungeons and various abandoned buildings lies secrets that
    could change the face of the Earth. Some may save the Empires and Dynasty from killing each other off, while others
    may start a war with all Empires and Dynasties in an all out war.


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Swamp Lands:
    Swamp Lands is a marsh of bog with various different creatures that live in the lands. Majority of the creatures
    are hostile throughout the lands. In the Town and City that are in the Swamp Lands are the only places that law and
    order are established. Anything outside of the walls are creatures that tend to want to kill or eat travellers.
    Travellers should be prepared to be on their guards when they move about the lands as many of the creatures have
    perfected hiding from their prey.


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Mordeau Dynasty:
    Mordeau Dynasty, a Dynasty that has been through it all from War to Civil War. Many of the populace is Drow with
    some Half-Orcs and Goblins. Other races live here as well within the Dynasty and have created a system that others
    have adopted around the Dynasty. They have a working alliance with the Dynasty to the South, the Tuskus Dynasty.
    Through this alliance they have pushed back Empire attacks that have tried to established a foothold within the
    Dynasty itself.
    The Mordeau Dynasty is a proud Dynasty and treats its citizens with the upmost respect. Some of the days will turn
    to night and continue to be night for days on end. The history of the Dynasty is not something to take lightly
    as Travelers who learn the hardship this Dynasty has gone through, they may grow to respect the Dynasty more than
    the Empire over time.
    Within the Desert landscape between Towns and Cities lies landscape filled with sand and very little water.
    Travellers should travel carefully to make sure that they have enough water for the trips between Towns and Cities
    or have a way to get water. There is also different kinds of creatures that lay in wait within the sandy landscapes
    for different kinds of prey.


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Tuskus Dynasty:
    The Tuskus Dynasty is a rough landscape to behold, and hard to transverse without knowing where to go or if you
    don't have a map to follow. The population is mainly Orcs, Giants, and other creatures that many outside of the
    Dynasty have not seen for quite some time.
    The Tuskus Dynasty gives respect to those who have killed creatures greater than themselves and think anyone that
    cannot kill a creature as weak should not be a part of the Dynasty. There are many parts of the Dynasty that
    have rarely been travelled through as the creatures become more difficult to defeat. Many of the Tribes find it to
    be a rite of passage to kill a specific creature and bring some part of it back as a trophy.
    The Tuskus Dynasty is preparing for war from the Rumors that have reached their lands and have been calling upon
    all Tribes to answer the call.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Triplet Islands:
    Triplet Islands is made of three Islands that are to the South of the Tuskus Dynasty that are a part of no faction.
    They tend to stick to themselves and leave the outside populace to their own problems. They welcome Smugglers,
    Mercenaries, and Criminals from all factions. The Islands have a way of keeping peace among the variety of populace
    with harsh conditions if individuals break laws.
    They also have a wide variety of contracts for Travellers that come through from very low price tags to incredibly
    high price tags. Travellers should choose wisely of which contract to pick. The Triplet Islands can be a very
    wealthy place if they find the right groups to get involved with.
    However, the island to the West is rumored to have treasures beyond one can dream, however those who have ventured
    there have never come back.


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Land of the Dead:
    The Land of the Dead used to be an island that thrived and created a market that the Empire and Dynasties both
    did business with. During the last war however, the fight between the Empire and the Dynasties raged throughout the
    island, destroying the populace.
    After the war was over the island was left in desolation and those who went to rebuild the city found the city was
    populated by something else that wasn't living. The dead have risen, and some dead were the combatants of
    the previous war from both sides. The individuals looking to rebuild fled among the ships back to the Dynasty in
    hopes that someone would come to save the island or put a stop to the dead in order to rebuild the once thriving
    city.
