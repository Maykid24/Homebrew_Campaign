Session 3 Recap - July 29, 2023

The group discusses and starts to move to the market to get some food. While waiting for food, the group finds an individual staring at them
across the pond. Borky see's the individual and starts to immediately run after him and Bob follows. The rest of the group waits for the food
before moving forward. The group follows the individual back to the house they were just in. 

Bob then looks for the individual in the house to find no one on the main floor. Immediately starts to investigate and finds a secret door, Hei 
looks for traps and doesn't find any and opens the door. Leading downwards the ladder goes down further then they can see. The group and after
awhile Borky starts to follow down the ladder into the cavern. The group moves forward to find 6 robed figures and a 7th in the middle. 
A battle insues after Bob sparta kicks one of the skeletons. With the group defeating the skeletons and skeleton minotaur they move forward.
After crossing a long bridge, and a secret hallway that makes the group see what they fear the most, are able to proceed. Once through,
Borky gets a whisper and is frightened which makes him enlarge and tries to run forward while enlarged. After a minute or so, Borky becomes 
normal and immediately starts to sprint forward. The group follows to see where the hallway is going. At the top of the stairs they stand 
face to face with a figure wearing the same robe they saw previously. Without any warning, (And to DM's flabbergasted surprise) Borky runs 
past the individual and goes straight into the portal. Caught off guard and speechless, Hei sneaks past and jumps into the portal without 
anyone noticing. The individual then invites the rest to go through the portal still somewhat speechless, and frightens Mara into running 
into the portal to join the rest.

Into the portal the group goes!
