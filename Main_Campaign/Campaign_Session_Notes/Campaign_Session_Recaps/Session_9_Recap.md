## Session 9 - Recap

The group decided to take a night rest by the lake, a powerful goddess of nature appears from the lake and grants each member of the group either power or knowledge. Borky and Mara chose power and therefore gained an additional feat. Bob, Nessa, and Marissa chose knowledge. 

Bob wanted to have his memories back, but was only given a fraction of his memory of a time he saw Borky, a group of individuals that handed Borky a box, then shortly after a massive explosion. Bob was told that other memories were fractured.

Nessa wanting to know where a group of individuals were, was told they were what looked to be the Traders Cove.

Marissa wanting to know how to help Bob with his memories, Borky with his... intelligence... and how to best help the rest of the group. She was shown a potion that would help Bob, a bracelet that would help Borky, and saw herself with the group in the last image.

After all said and done, the group found a new friend or at least Marissa did, a nice little fox decided to join the party. As the group headed up the mountain, Borky decided to fight the goats and got knocked off into the water below. After being beamed over to the shore, Borky decided to have a standoff with the goats as the rest of the group decided to mine ore at the top of the mountain.

Shortly after, a Bullette started to come closer and closer to the group which made the group go back to the city. During this time, the group decided to name themselves the Silver Hands and appointed themselves the rank of Purifiers.

    - Borky: Teal Purifier
    - Bob: Purifier of Rememberance 
    - Nessa: Purifier of Blades
    - Mara: Moon Touched Purifier
    - Rissa: Brave Purifier

Once back into the city the group stopped at the Dirty Jug where Marissa saw the potion for Bob, as Bob drank the potion he started to have a memory overload transfer. While that was occurring Marissa also got the Arva to give over the bracelet.

Once done, the group went back to the Dirty Jug to find that Arva found a strange egg within the Bullette armor. After looking at it, Mara decided to speak Draconic to hit and the egg started to move. The group decided to leave the shop to discuss options of the egg quickly before realizing the egg hatched. Mara ran inside the shop, got the little gold dragon to hop onto her hand and ran out of the shop. Up above, they saw dirt fall from the mountain ceiling and Mara started running to the front gates.
