# Session 3 Recap - July 29, 2023

The group discusses and starts to move to the market to get some food. While waiting for food, the group finds an individual staring at them across the pond. Borky sees the individual and immediately starts running after him, with Bob following. The rest of the group waits for the food before moving forward. The group follows the individual back to the house they were just in.

Bob then looks for the individual in the house to find no one on the main floor. He immediately starts to investigate and finds a secret door. Hei checks for traps and doesn't find any, so she opens the door. The door leads downward, and the ladder goes down further than they can see. The group follows, and after a while, Borky starts to follow down the ladder into the cavern.

The group moves forward and finds 6 robed figures and a 7th figure in the middle. A battle ensues after Bob sparta kicks one of the skeletons. With the group defeating the skeletons and a skeleton minotaur, they move forward. After crossing a long bridge and passing through a secret hallway that makes the group see what they fear the most, they are able to proceed.

Once through, Borky gets a whisper and becomes frightened, causing him to enlarge and try to run forward while enlarged. After a minute or so, Borky becomes normal again and immediately starts to sprint forward. The group follows to see where the hallway is going. At the top of the stairs, they stand face to face with a figure wearing the same robe they saw previously. Without any warning (and to the DM's flabbergasted surprise), Borky runs past the individual and goes straight into the portal. Caught off guard and speechless, Hei sneaks past and jumps into the portal without anyone noticing. The individual then invites the rest to go through the portal, still somewhat speechless, and frightens Mara into running into the portal to join the rest.

And into the portal, the group goes!
