## Session 10 - Recap

The members of the Silver Hand promptly run out of the mountain with the baby dragon in hand looking for the mom dragon. However, no dragon was found only a goat following them. Later was found out that the goat was the mom dragon and Mara took a blood pact with the dragon that her life is now the baby dragons and the baby dragon is now Maras. 

Once this was complete, the group went back to the city, some went to the port for some food of the baby dragon, Bob and Borky went to the library in the Dwarven city. Both groups were successful, the baby dragon grew quickly. Bob learned quite a bit of knowledge overall. At the tavern Rissa found that being a chef's helper was a little rough in the Dwarven city. 

The next day the group went to the Dirty Jug to find a way to get the dragon hidden as it grew significantly bigger. They were given a necklace for the dragon to start shapeshifting to blend in. Also was given gloves in order to hide the scales that was continuing to grow on Mara's hand. 

The group then went to the Smelt Belt to pick up items that they discussed with Tordek the day before. 

- 5lbs Gold: 50gp / 1lbs
- 5lbs Silver: 50sp / 1lbs
- 5lbs Plat: 500gp / 1lbs
- 11lbs Elyrium

The group now is ready to head into the mines to see if they can continue to help with the Dreugar.
