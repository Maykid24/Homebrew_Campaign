## Session 6 Recap - September 24, 2023

- Group woke up and started to figure out what they needed to do for the day
- Group went around to various different shops looking for bloody hand bread crumbs and on their rounds they found that shop keepers had different items for them to do in order to make some deals or make some money
- Once getting to the end of the bread crumbs the group decided to venture into the mines looking for the bounty of creatures/monsters in the mines that are keeping the dwarves from mining even further
- Once in the mines the main dwarf on watch had another dwarf miner lead them to the end point of where the dwarves stopped mining due to creatures / monster being down further
- After following the mine shaft even further down the group found a spot and started to mine ore
- After mining some the group heard voices coming from lower down, after investigating they found 4 individuals speaking deep grunt voices walking towards them
