### Completing the Time Loop:
- When a character enters a room and another character enters the room next to it, the red lights then turn green.
  - Anyone looking at the lights can clearly see the change if they are looking
- If all 5 group members go into their own individual room:
  - All lights turn green which gives a magical spark that all lights point to the massive crystal above and the crystal shoots a beam directly downwards creating a massive 20 foot portal for the group to jump into to exit
