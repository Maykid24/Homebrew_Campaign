# Session 2 Recap - July 24, 2023

The group gets up from the night and starts to head downstairs to the Inn. They start to talk to the innkeeper and something seems off. Bob casts detect magic and notices the same kind of runes on his chest as the other individual with runes on his neck. They press further and find the innkeeper moving into the back quickly. The group quickly finds the actual innkeeper bound, and when unbounding, the magic wore off, and the innkeeper looked to be dead for some time. The group decided not to follow and get the guards involved.

An arcane user named Zehmar came quickly to investigate the situation and seemed very curious about the magic. He told the group to come to the capital grounds in roughly 8 hours or so. During this time, a guard named Gan escorts the group while Hei is trying to flirt with him the entire way to the innkeeper's house.

Once at the house, they look to see if the door had magical means and found something around the door. Instead, Borky decides to break a window and starts taking out the pieces of glass to get in. Hei goes into the house and looks around quickly, not seeing anyone, comes back out, and Bob goes into the house and over to the door. Bob opens the door and goes through to find that it's a different reality where no one is on the streets. Mara finally gets through the window, and Borky gets stuck. After some pulling and pushing, the group breaks the window frame and somewhat cracks the foundation.

After further investigation, the group found trap doors and other traps that they set off one after another and disarm a few. Upstairs, Bob and Nessa step through into the bedroom to find they are now stuck in a different reality. After some time, the group figures out how to get Bob and Nessa back and able to get them back into the same reality.

The group has found documents, 5 boxes, and a book with a bloody hand on the face of it. However, all the boxes are magically bound, and the book is also magically bound. The group is now outside the house, potentially going to the market to get some food, or maybe something else happens...

The group shall decide!
