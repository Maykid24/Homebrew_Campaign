Starting Campaign:

    - Group runs into a hooded figure running from the assassination attempt of Gedef Borsk, not able to catch them. If
    attempted the group is reminded very quickly they are not ready for this type of individual... yet.

    - The group finds different scenarios of the bloody hand left after a few different missions, etc., may get led in
    the wrong direction by people serving the Nine Hells, and other patrons that want nothing but chaos

    - If group finds out what the enemy is, they may begin to start finding the covens and secret hideouts if looking
    in the right direction, right place or investigating correct individuals

    - After a while of adventuring and the group transversing the lands, there is a massive explosion in one of the
    cities or towns that the group is in and brings this campaign to a whole new level

    - The group finally meets and faces Vetra, the 5th commander of the Mournings Shadow
        Big fight to be had =D
