• Was born in the Triplet Islands
• At the age of 5, was sold to slavers by my own parents, who eventually brought me to the city of Zale.
• Was then sold to the operators of an underground fight ring (most fights were to the death).
• My first fight was supposed to be a form of entertainment that led to my death, but to everyone’s surprise, I survived.
• Within a year, I became the champion and the favorite to watch.
• At the age of 15, I started a rebellion to gain freedom for myself and others who no longer wished to fight. However, the top operators managed to escape.
• Became a mercenary at first to earn money, later used my connections to hunt down the operators that escaped.
• To this day, they managed to evade me every time I get a lead.
