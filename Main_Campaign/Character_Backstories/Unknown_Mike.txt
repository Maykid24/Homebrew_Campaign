Mikes Character:

Lawful Good

Still a work in progress, but this is what I am thinking so far:

Character is old (unknown), but has a mind of a 20yr. Suffers from amnesia and is trying to figure out why. 
Has roots to a small to medium sized town (I will let you pick where this works). Remember being religious. 
Mom died when the character was young, causes unknown, so father raised the character.

Character believes that speaking too much changes the world for the worse, so while they can speak, they often choose not to. 
Can think of them as “selectively mute”

As per its nature, the cause of amnesia is unknown as well as when. Half-elves can live up to 180 years, so the exact time is unknown. 
The cause may have been due to a terrible tragic event for the character, was cursed, found a silly magic found that triggered this, 
or maybe the character has died and is reliving their past life. IDK. What the character does know is that before when growing up the 
character wasn’t able to learn from or talk to a mysterious voice that seems to guide them. This voice offers to restore the memory (memories?) 
as the campaign continues.

Notes:

    - Maybe tie it with Tylers explosion of the item that Borky had in his hands... Ties into the BBEG altogether. Explosion caused the
        amnesia and was a random individual that was hit by the explosion. Tying the group overall together of why everyone in the group 
        was brought together.
