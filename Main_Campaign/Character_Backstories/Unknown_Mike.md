**Mike's Character:**

**Alignment:** Lawful Good

Still a work in progress, but this is what I am thinking so far:

The character is old (unknown), but has the mind of a 20-year-old. Suffers from amnesia and is trying to figure out why. 
Has roots in a small to medium-sized town (you can pick the location that works). Remembers being religious. 
The character's mother died when they were young, the cause of which is unknown, so the character's father raised them.

The character believes that speaking too much changes the world for the worse, so while they can speak, they often choose not to. 
You can think of them as "selectively mute."

As per its nature, the cause of amnesia is unknown, as well as when it occurred. Half-elves can live up to 180 years, so the exact time is unknown. 
The cause may have been due to a terrible tragic event for the character, a curse, finding a silly magic item that triggered this, 
or maybe the character has died and is reliving their past life. IDK. What the character does know is that before growing up, 
the character wasn't able to learn from or talk to a mysterious voice that seems to guide them. This voice offers to restore the memory (memories?) 
as the campaign continues.

**Notes:**

- Maybe tie it with Tyler's explosion of the item that Borky had in his hands... Ties into the BBEG altogether. The explosion caused the
  amnesia and hit a random individual, who happened to be the character. Tying the group overall together of why everyone in the group 
  was brought together.
