## Michelles Character: Marissa Valdie ##

*Aka: “Hey Stoopid, shut the fuck up!”*
Halfling Rogue Thief

**Mother:** Full Halfling
**Name:** Larissa (Brownlock) Valdie
**Status:** Deceased

**Father:** Drow Elf
**Name:** Mocarn Valdie
**Status:** Allegedly Deceased

Larissa and Mocarn met right as he was starting to become involved with a Criminal Syndicate led by Drow (insert name here). Larissa’s love and devotion to Mocarn essentially saved him from going down the wrong path. Marissa was born to Larissa and Mocarn in the early spring, and shortly after Marissa’s 10th birthday, Larissa became ill and died. Mocarn, distraught with grief, began to drink heavily.

Within a year of Larissa’s death, Mocarn had become deeply indebted to the Drow whom he once knew. The day the bill came due for Mocarn’s debt, he met with the Drow and told him he did not have the means to pay back his debt. Mocarn pleaded with the Drow to give him an extension, but the Drow refused. As the Drow’s henchmen began to close in on Mocarn, the Drow gave Mocarn a last option - to give up his daughter as payment in full or be removed from his presence, permanently. With a smirk of a smile, the Drow said, “We need a small person to go where my men cannot.” With a slight nod of his head, he agreed. Without looking at his daughter, Marissa, he slowly got up and left.

For the next 10 years, Marissa lived with the Drow Father. He had sent her to the household staff to fulfill any role needed. She cleaned and helped in the kitchen, and she slept on a pallet on the floor of a small and dingy room. While she did know how to read and write, no additional education was offered. The Drow Father spent very little time with her, but as she got older, he began to spend more and more time with her. Shortly before her 21st birthday, the Drow Father pulled her into his study and told her, without any emotion, that her Father, Mocarn, was dead. He also told her she would begin her training after her 21st birthday.

The day after her 21st birthday, the Drow Father told her to report to a member of the ‘family’ for training. For the next 3 years, Marissa trained with a wide range of operators to learn and grow her skillset. And now, for the past 2 years, she has been operating on her own, using her small stature, her child-like looks, deep Southern accent, and her ramblings to her advantage.

Until one day, the Drow Father calls her into his office. He tells her she is to travel to the City of Zale to steal a dark Mahogany box from a very wealthy citizen. When she asks what is in the box, he backhands her across the face and in a low and menacing voice, “That is not your concern. You are to sneak into the house, steal the box, and return it to me. You will do this by any means necessary. Do you understand? No matter how long it takes and even if you must kill, you will bring me this box.”

Never had the Drow Father hit her, and he had always told her exactly what she was stealing. Never before had the Drow Father told her to kill. During all her training and solo missions, Marissa operated by a set of morals: A private code. Never to steal from or hurt the poor, children, animals, and certainly never to kill. She was a thief, not a murderer.

Now, at the age of 26, she finds herself in a tavern in the City of Zale, contemplating this mission. She certainly can steal this box, but can she do it by any means necessary?

Marissa always wears long sleeves and long pants. This is to hide her dark Drow skin which is spotted all over her body except her neck, face, head, and hands.
