## Bob - Zanros

- Family:
    - Mother: Nevla
    - Sister: Silra

Zanros's tale begins in the heart of the Twinland Empire, where he lived with his mother Nevla and his younger sister Sirla. The family resided in a bustling city, and Zanros, even from a young age, displayed an insatiable curiosity and thirst for knowledge. His dream was to attend the renowned university that stood as a beacon of learning and magic within the empire.

One day, Zanros received the long-awaited acceptance letter to the university. Excitement surged through him as he shared the news with his family. His mother and sister beamed with pride, and they prepared for a joyous celebration. However, the festivities were abruptly interrupted by a sudden and mysterious attack on their home, leaving chaos and destruction in its wake.

In the midst of the chaos, a powerful spell was cast, and Zanros woke up disoriented and alone in a distant town, his memories of that tragic night erased. Carrying only the acceptance letter to the university and a pendant that once belonged to his mother, Zanros set out on a journey to reclaim his past. His memory loss left him with a persistent sense of emptiness, a void he desperately sought to fill.

As he traveled, he discovered his innate magical abilities, and whispers from an otherworldly entity began to guide him. Unbeknownst to Zanros, the missing pieces of his memory were intentionally hidden, but the reasons behind it remain shrouded in mystery.

Zanros's journey as a warlock became a quest for self-discovery and a pursuit of the truth. Along the way, he encountered allies who sensed the magical threads tying him to a greater destiny. As he delved into his magical abilities, he unwittingly drew closer to the secrets of his past. The path ahead is fraught with danger, secrets, and the looming presence of an unknown adversary whose motivations are yet to be revealed.
