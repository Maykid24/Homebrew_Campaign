Tylers Character:

BORKY DA ORCY (rough draft backstory)
*As with most backstories keep this secret from the players, I like the exploration of other backstories to be exciting as they are discovered.
•	Borky has been in prison for a few years for a crime he has no memory of…
o	Borky has learned loosely why he is in prison because he messed with an uber powerful wizards’ stuff as a criminal, or he was framed for the sake of convenience because the arcane explosion nearby wiped his memory??? Idk his class is a sorcerer and a wild magic one at that, he’s got some sort of retrograde arcane long/short term memory loss.
	The real reason why he’s in prison is your DM’s sandbox playground, surprise me or it could be his call to action for adventure… the path of clearing his name/righting a wrong/his redemption story arc.
o	Borky is a lawful good character I’m going to try and take a shot at, he’s at heart a good guy, and the prison has shown him the worst in people with prime examples of what being bad/evil are.
•	Borky is an idiot with preferably low intelligence and near maxed charisma, as being in prison he’s learned to chat with people rather than fight.
o	Borky can’t read/forgot due to his (insert arcane equivalent memory loss.) so in an attempt to call jail/prison something more comfortable, he refers to it as THE SLAMMA.
•	Due to arcane amnesia?? He doesn’t know where he came from/upbringing, and his old acquaintances minus the ones in prison he doesn’t remember.
o	The people he does know are all still in prison, technically I would like to be apart of some sort of criminal syndicate/organization he met inside of prison… and as an idiot not knowing what he signed up for though it would be a great idea to get their version of a CRIP/BLOOD/YAKUZA tattoo.
	I was thinking the tattoo be a coiled snake that wraps around the right arm as the head and fangs look to sink into his jugular.
•	I may make up random ass characters he has met from prison that serve some sort of joke or bit, or some relevant situation that is currently occurring in game. 50% he’s making up bullshit/forgot or he’s telling the truth.
**and most importantly thanks to the podcast I’ve got this guy from, every single morning he wakes up he has a catch phrase he yells… “It’s time to get Orcy, its time to get Borky, WWAAAAHHHHHHHHGGG” **
