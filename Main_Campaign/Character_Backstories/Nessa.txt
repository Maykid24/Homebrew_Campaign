•	Was born in the Triplet Islands
•	At the age of 5, was sold to slavers by my own parents.  Who eventually brought me to the city of Zale.
•	Was then sold to the operators of an underground fight ring (most fights were to the death)
•	My first fight was supposed to be a for of entertainment that led to my death, but to everyone’s surprise I had survived.
•	Within a year became the champion and favorite to watch.
•	At the age of 15, I started a rebellion to gain freedom for me and others that no longer wished to fight, 
    however the top operators managed to escape.
•	Became a mercenary at first to earn money, later used my connections to hunt down the operators that escaped.
•	To this day they managed to evade me every time I get a lead.
