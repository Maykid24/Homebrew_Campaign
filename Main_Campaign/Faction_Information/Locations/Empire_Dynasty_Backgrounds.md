### Empire/Dynasty Backgrounds: ###

#### Gorvan Empire: ####
The Gorvan Empire has waged wars throughout history, mainly for land and resources. It's a prideful Empire that solely focuses on military might and the prosperous mercenaries that help throughout the lands. The Gorvan Empire is mainly Humans with very little variation of races throughout. In some Cities and Towns, the laws are strict, while in others, the laws are a little less enforced.

War hasn't raged with the Gorvan Empire in over 50 years, and the Empire is itching towards war, but with whom?

#### Land of Ice: ####
The Land of Snow and Ice, where only a few live amidst cold dangers. Typically, they keep to themselves but at times they raid to the south in the Gorvan Empire for food and slaves. The Land of Ice is made up of Goliaths, Trolls, Giants, and other monstrous beasts that live in the cold depths.

The Land of Ice has a vast mountain range along with deep snow valleys that can reach 25 feet high. Without the proper equipment or clothing, it's deadly for those who venture too far into the land of freezing.

#### Twinland Empire: ####
Sister Empire to the Gorvan Empire. It has been allies with the Gorvan Empire for many centuries. The alliance is strong, but there are talks that the alliance could be seeing cracks forming, and with enough nudge, it could alter the alliance completely. There have been groups that have wanted to disrupt this alliance over the last century to inflict chaos and create a new Empire under new ruling, but they have not yet succeeded.

The growing tensions have caused citizens to be wary of outsiders and less trustworthy of them. Some, however, feel the outsiders are needed, while others give a cold shoulder as they are unsure of their intentions. The majority of the Twinland Empire is Human with additional Halflings and Gnomes. Other races are welcomed, but citizens keep a distance between them and are wary.

#### Land of Arial: ####
The Land of the Elves and Gnomes, though uncommon, the Elves and the Gnomes work together quite well. The Gnomes mine the largest mountain behind the City of the Olsa Thalor while Elves barter with the Gnomes for what comes out of the Mine. There are other landscapes and mountains that contain other treasures and sometimes other things that live deep beneath the mountains.

The land is, for the most part, peaceful and stays out of the politics of the outside Empires and Dynasty. It has been quite some time since the Land of Arial has gone to war. However, they have an army that has seen many wars and is not new to battle.

With the Gnomes mining and creating armor that the rest of the world has never seen, the Elven army is armed with some of the fiercest weapons and armor the current world has yet to see. There may come a time when the world will see what the Land of Arial has.

#### Land of Iron: ####
A simple mining island that has found an Iron deposit that seems to never end. The Land of Iron is under the protection of the Twinland Empire as the island consists of miners and merchants looking to make enough money to retire in the farmlands of the Twinland Empire.

The island is made up of various races, during the day it's pure business, but during the night, the laws tend to be less enforced and gets rowdy from time to time. The mines are mainly Iron with a few gems here and there that merchants buy and sell to travelers looking for unique gems.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Land of Coal: ####
Main island for Coal for the Empire states, not ruled by any main Empire faction but is protected by a mercenary group that has named themselves the Dark Candidates. They are always hiring additional mercenaries looking for work as well as hiring travelers to take care of monsters that live deep within the coal mine and pirates that linger around the island.

The island is very well self-sufficient and creates a massive amount of income from the bartering of Coal to the Empire and secretly to the Dynasties that live to the East. They have a contract with the Empire states that the coal will only go to the Empire and that any coal going to the Dynasties will be an act of war.

The Land of Coal is also a great place to find Smugglers who are very good at their trade and getting past armadas that may be patrolling the outskirts.

#### Triple Dead Islands: ####
Triple Dead Islands used to thrive on the three islands and be incredibly wealthy. The only standing city is Volkrau, a city that is having the population leave in fear of what happened to the other two islands. Rumors have gone around that the other two islands started having the dead rise up from the ground and take over the islands. They sent forces to face the dead and each force that they sent, none came back. They abandoned the island to the South and the North.

People within the city have heard that the dead are starting to rise on the main island now, as people hear this, they are jumping on ships and getting out of the city.

The people that stay want to live on the island while others stay for the treasure that they've heard that lies to the North and South islands. There are some individuals on the island, however, think a Necromancer is the cause of the Dead rising up and taking over the Triple Islands. But, no one yet has offered to help to see what the cause actually is and if they can stop it or not.

#### Dwarven Island: ####
The land of the Dwarves. The Island is mainly of Dwarves with a few outsiders that have gained the trust of the Dwarves. They tend to keep to their mine that lies deep beneath the Mountain. A very stubborn bunch of Dwarves that love the Gold that comes out of the mine. They have fought off Dragons who have tried to lay waste to the Dwarves, and they have crafted armor and weapons that suit their needs.

They are willing to trade and barter with outsiders, giving tasks to travelers looking for a quick coin. They have heard rumors of a war starting to brew up, and the weapon and armor manufacturing has kicked up tenfold to make sure they are ready for any kind of war that may come.

The Dwarves are very good at playing drinking games during the night as well, with travelers trying to gain more coin than they currently have.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Traders Cove: ####
Traders Cove or what some may call the Mercenary hiring grounds for both Empire and the Dynasty. Others who know the origin of Traders Cove know it as `Smugglers Paradise`. This is where things become lawless between the three islands and where most people will go to the highest bidder. The majority of the people that live on the islands don't have any allegiance, so long as they are getting paid.

This is also the place to stop and get contraband from the Empire and Dynasty that Smugglers have acquired through various means. It may cost a little bit of money, but there are ways to obtain the money to get the items wanted.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Island of Secrets: ####
Very few have ever gone to the Island of Secrets as the rumors tend to scare the majority of the population. For those that wish to travel to the island, they will find that the island is full of monsters and creatures that are both friendly and very hostile. But what lies beneath dungeons and various abandoned buildings lies secrets that could change the face of the Earth. Some may save the Empires and Dynasty from killing each other off, while others may start a war with all Empires and Dynasties in an all-out war.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Swamp Lands: ####
Swamp Lands is a marsh of bog with various different creatures that live in the lands. The majority of the creatures are hostile throughout the lands. In the Town and City that are in the Swamp Lands, are the only places that law and order are established. Anything outside of the walls are creatures that tend to want to kill or eat travelers. Travelers should be prepared to be on their guards when they move about the lands as many of the creatures have perfected hiding from their prey.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Mordeau Dynasty: ####
Mordeau Dynasty, a Dynasty that has been through it all from War to Civil War. Many of the populace are Drow with some Half-Orcs and Goblins. Other races live here as well within the Dynasty and have created a system that others have adopted around the Dynasty. They have a working alliance with the Dynasty to the South, the Tuskus Dynasty. Through this alliance, they have pushed back Empire attacks that have tried to establish a foothold within the Dynasty itself.

The Mordeau Dynasty is a proud Dynasty and treats its citizens with the utmost respect. Some of the days will turn to night and continue to be night for days on end. The history of the Dynasty is not something to take lightly as Travelers who learn the hardship this Dynasty has gone through, they may grow to respect the Dynasty more than the Empire over time.

Within the Desert landscape between Towns and Cities lies a landscape filled with sand and very little water. Travelers should travel carefully to make sure that they have enough water for the trips between Towns and Cities or have a way to get water. There are also different kinds of creatures that lie in wait within the sandy landscapes for different kinds of prey.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Tuskus Dynasty: ####
The Tuskus Dynasty is a rough landscape to behold and hard to traverse without knowing where to go or if you don't have a map to follow. The population is mainly Orcs, Giants, and other creatures that many outside of the Dynasty have not seen for quite some time.

The Tuskus Dynasty gives respect to those who have killed creatures greater than themselves and think anyone that cannot kill a creature as weak should not be a part of the Dynasty. There are many parts of the Dynasty that have rarely been traveled through as the creatures become more difficult to defeat. Many of the Tribes find it to be a rite of passage to kill a specific creature and bring some part of it back as a trophy.

The Tuskus Dynasty is preparing for war from the Rumors that have reached their lands and have been calling upon all Tribes to answer the call.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Triplet Islands: ####
Triplet Islands are made of three Islands that are to the South of the Tuskus Dynasty that are a part of no faction. They tend to stick to themselves and leave the outside populace to their own problems. They welcome Smugglers, Mercenaries, and Criminals from all factions. The Islands have a way of keeping peace among the variety of populace with harsh conditions if individuals break laws.

They also have a wide variety of contracts for Travelers that come through, from very low price tags to incredibly high price tags. Travelers should choose wisely of which contract to pick. The Triplet Islands can be a very wealthy place if they find the right groups to get involved with.

However, the island to the West is rumored to have treasures beyond one can dream, however those who have ventured there have never come back.

#### Land of the Dead: ####
The Land of the Dead used to be an island that thrived and created a market that the Empire and Dynasties both did business with. During the last war, however, the fight between the Empire and the Dynasties raged throughout the island, destroying the populace.

After the war was over the island was left in desolation and those who went to rebuild the city found the city was populated by something else that wasn't living. The dead have risen, and some dead were the combatants of the previous war from both sides. The individuals looking to rebuild fled among the ships back to the Dynasty in hopes that someone would come to save the island or put a stop to the dead in order to rebuild the once thriving city.
