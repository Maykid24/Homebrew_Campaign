# Idea

- Tying the entire group together of why they were all brought together and how forces beyond their imagination have ways of guiding them together to stop an evil so great that it could possibly destroy the realm and all realms near it.

## Backgrounds:

### Marissa Valdie

- Was tasked to take an item from an individual.

### Borky Da Orcy

- Had an item but a magical explosion occurred, causing him to serve time in prison.

### Mike's Character (Unknown)

- Was a civilian that was hit by the explosion of Borky that gave him amnesia, and the voice in his head is guiding him to the group he's now a part of.
