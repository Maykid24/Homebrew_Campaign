## Session 17 - Jan 27, 2024

- The Silver Hands landed on the triple dead islands to find that the island was filled with zombies and skeletons
- The group transversed stealthly along the coast line and up a massive mountain where Borky made a new giant skeleton friend to take him up the mountain so he didn't have to climb. However as Borky continued to get to the top, demons started to fly out of the mountain and started to attack the giant skeleton. With another suggestion from Borky, a demon flyer grabbed Borky and brought him back down to his friends safe and sound
- After daylight hit again the group continued down the coast line to find a narrow passage way where they could see a ship
- Nessa with a good roll spotted a ship in the distance and the group got to work putting together a fire that the ship saw and started to move towards the island
- Bob however, wanted to see if they could find anything like what they found in the Dwarven islands to gain special powers from a goddess
- After searching for a little bit on top of the hill, Bob found a river that lead into the mountain. The rest of the group except for Mara and Rissa followed Bob into the cave
- After the sailors landed and Mara and Rissa help explain what happened, they ran off to go find Bob and the rest of the group
- Inside the cave, Bob and the rest waited for some time until the rest of the group appeared. Then a voice came over and asked each one to step into the water and as they did, they immediately submerged. All except for Mara, Mara was not allowed into the waters of the cave like the rest for some unknown reason...
