### Completing the Time Loop:
- When a character enters a room and another character enters the room next to it, the red lights then turn green.
  - Anyone looking at the lights can clearly see the change if they are looking
- If all 5 group members go into their own individual room:
  - All lights turn green which gives a magical spark that all lights point to the massive crystal above and the crystal shoots a beam directly downwards creating a massive 20 foot portal for the group to jump into to exit

#### Turn Order Mechanics:
- Each time a new creature comes into this time loop all other characters are teleported back to the portal as a reset

*The below only happens after all creatures are in the time loop*
- For the **first 6 turns**:
  - Every 2 turns the characters get teleported back to the portal if not solved yet
- After 6 turns:
  - Roll 1d4
  1. At the end of 1 turn, characters are teleported back to the portal 
  2. At the end of 2 turns, characters are teleported back to the portal
  3. At the end of 3 turns, characters are teleported back to the portal
  4. At the end of 4 turns, characters are teleported back to the portal

### If characters are having a difficult time:

- Give very subtle hints if the characters are not getting it to keep progressing through
- Give the ability to see different aspects and point out things that they may not pick up on right off the bat, but don't fully give it away
- Somewhat nudge the characters in the right direction
