### Traps / Items in the library:

    - Roll d20 to determine if any of these occur
        - 17+ something below happens

1. **Bookworm Curse:**
   - Opening a particular book triggers a curse that transforms the reader into a swarm of magical bookworms. The rest of the party must find a specific counter-curse within a time limit, or the affected character becomes permanently trapped in this form.

2. **Illusory Hallways:**
   - Certain sections of the library are enchanted to create illusory hallways that lead the party in circles or to dead ends. Overcoming this trap requires a keen eye or magical means to detect illusions.

3. **Glyphed Thresholds:**
   - Some doorways are protected by hidden glyphs. Opening the door without deactivating the glyphs first triggers a magical effect, such as a lightning bolt, paralysis, or a temporary teleportation to a different part of the library.

4. **Shifting Shelves:**
   - The shelves themselves are enchanted to shift and rearrange when triggered. This can separate party members or block passages, forcing the group to solve a puzzle or find a specific trigger to stabilize the shelves.

5. **Animated Books:**
   - Books in certain sections come to life, flying off the shelves and attacking intruders. The books might contain the knowledge of long-dead mages and use their magical abilities against the party.

6. **Gravity Manipulation Traps:**
   - Activating a hidden pressure plate causes a localized alteration in gravity, leading to a sudden shift in orientation for the affected area. This can disorient the party and potentially cause falling damage.

7. **Temporal Distortion:**
   - Certain areas of the library exist in a state of temporal distortion. Entering these zones can cause time to pass differently, leading to accelerated aging or temporary time loops.

8. **Echoing Whispers:**
   - Books in the restricted section contain trapped spirits or entities that communicate through whispers. A character reading the wrong book may be subjected to psychic damage or temporary madness.

Remember to provide hints or clues within the library environment to allow the players to discover and overcome these challenges. Additionally, the consequences of failure should be balanced to maintain an engaging and challenging experience without being overly punishing.


### Solutions to the above:


1. **Bookworm Curse Solution:**
   - Find a specific counter-curse hidden within the restricted section or seek guidance from a knowledgeable NPC within the library.

2. **Illusory Hallways Solution:**
   - Use magical means, such as Detect Magic or True Sight, to identify the illusion and navigate through the real passages.

3. **Glyphed Thresholds Solution:**
   - Search for hidden glyphs before attempting to open doors. Disarm the glyphs using magical means, or find a specific item or spell to bypass them safely.

4. **Shifting Shelves Solution:**
   - Discover a pattern or trigger that stabilizes the shelves, allowing safe passage. Solve a puzzle or riddle to reveal the correct sequence.

5. **Animated Books Solution:**
   - Use protective spells, such as Mage Armor or Shield, to mitigate damage. Find a way to pacify or banish the animated books, perhaps through a magical item or a specific spell.

6. **Gravity Manipulation Traps Solution:**
   - Identify pressure plates or triggers in advance and disable them. Use magical means to mitigate the effects of altered gravity, such as Feather Fall or Levitate.

7. **Temporal Distortion Solution:**
   - Find a way to anchor time within the distorted areas, either through a specific spell or a magical item. Seek guidance from a time-oriented NPC or creature within the library.

8. **Echoing Whispers Solution:**
   - Use protective measures against psychic damage, such as Resistance or a magical item. Find a way to communicate with the trapped spirits and negotiate a safe passage without succumbing to madness.
