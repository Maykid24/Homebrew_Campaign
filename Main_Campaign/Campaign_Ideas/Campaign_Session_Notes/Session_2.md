The group found out that the innkeeper wasn't exactly who he said he was and was a part of the Bloody Hands network. After finding this out, the guards allowed the group to search the innkeeper's house to see if they could find anything. They ran into multiple different traps, including a trap that altered reality.

During the search, the group found 5 boxes, 1 book of the Bloody Hands, and other documents.

Afterwards, the group decided to go to the market as they were hungry.
