### Actions
- **Multiattack**: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite**: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) acid damage.
- **Claw**: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.
- **Tail**: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
- **Frightful Presence**: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the dragon is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6)**: The dragon exhales acid in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Legendary Actions
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Detect**: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack**: The dragon makes a tail attack.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.
- A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) poison damage.

### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary black dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.
- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.
- Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the BBEG takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the BBEG can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

1. **Summon Arcane Constructs**: Two arcane constructs (use the stats of Shield Guardians) appear and fight for the BBEG until destroyed. They disappear when the BBEG uses this lair action again or dies.
2. **Arcane Storm**: A storm of raw magic erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the BBEG can see within 120 feet. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (6d6) force damage and be blinded until the end of its next turn.
3. **Magic Drain**: The BBEG targets one creature it can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or lose one spell slot of the highest level it has available. If the target has no spell slots, it takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage instead.

### Battle Tactics

- **Preparation**: The BBEG will have **Mage Armor**, **Mind Blank**, and **Greater Invisibility** active before the battle begins.
- **Initial Rounds**: Use **Time Stop** to position strategically, cast **Meteor Swarm** for massive damage, and **Wall of Force** to isolate threats.
- **Mid Battle**: Use **Counterspell** liberally to disrupt the party's spellcasters, and **Disintegrate** or **Finger of Death** to take out key targets.
- **Defensive Actions**: Utilize **Shield**, **Mirror Image**, and **Globe of Invulnerability** to mitigate damage.
- **Mobility**: Use **Teleport** and **Misty Step** to stay out of reach and maintain control of the battlefield.
- **Final Gambit**: If cornered, the BBEG can **Teleport** away to a pre-prepared safe location or unleash **Arcane Burst** to damage and potentially kill surrounding foes.

### Lair Setup

- **Arcane Sanctum**: The lair is filled with magical traps and arcane constructs ready to defend their master.
- **Environmental Hazards**: The lair is unstable, with arcane energy surges and collapsing structures to provide dynamic combat scenarios.
