## Session 12 - Recap

- The Silver Hands travels with the Duergar back to the Duergar city. They are able to see parts and pieces of the city before something thunderous sounds coming from the massive doors. Miner dwarves went running through the city and Mara stopped one of the dwarves to find out what was happening. The dwarf had nothing to say except they were scared, frightened and wanted to get out. 

- The group is forced to choose another location to be teleported too, which they choose Olsa Thalor. Once the Silver Hands arrived, they were interrupted by an high elf that heard the teleportation circle. They were asked for their names and where they came from, then sent on their way.

- The Silver Hands went to the Pink Raven to get rooms and finally go to sleep. The group then awoke and went to Hibana Crafts where they found Felix and Sandra. After some discussion, the group decided to go back to the Pink Raven and come back in the morning to buy materials in order to be escorted to the elven library.
