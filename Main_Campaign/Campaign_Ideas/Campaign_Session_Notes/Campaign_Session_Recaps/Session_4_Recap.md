## Session 4 Recap - August 20, 2023

Start of the session, the group is teleported into a room one by one with 5 doorways that are far too dark to look through.
Every couple turns the group gets teleported back to the original position. As the group searches each room, Hei finds Boots of Striding 
and Springing. After some time the group figures out how to do the portal and exits.
When the group is now teleported into the bottom of a boat they see a man wiping down the floors, Darron. Bob confronts Darron with the 
bloody hand book, and Darron is essentially scared by it. Darron goes and gets the Captain then comes back down to have the group follow up
top. When the group reaches the main deck they see the Captain, Seraphina Stormblade getting tattooed. After a little bit of conversation the 
group notices they are actually leaving Zale and on their way to the Dwarven Islands to pay a debt.

During this journey, Mara talks with Kaeler in the crows nest. Hei is helping the chef, Hodof Duv. Borky meets one of his previous friend,
Agom Kon. Bob and Nessa help out on deck.

As time moves forward, Seraphina talks with the group and discusses an objective for the group to stay on the ship. Essentially the payment to
a Dwarf filled with a chest of what looks to be gems, Seraphina wants the group to steal it back in order to keep sailing on the ship. Wary as 
the group is with this, they all agree to the terms. During this time Seraphina also offers to have her crew send messages for them back to Zale
for anything that may have been missed or needed conversations.
