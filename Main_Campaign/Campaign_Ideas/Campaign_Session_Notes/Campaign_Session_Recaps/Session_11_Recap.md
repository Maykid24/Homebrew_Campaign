## Session 11 Recap

- The Silver Hands went into the mines and found a multiple coridor maze that had some traps in it, along with treasure. After some time the group faced a few Druegar and looted the bodies. After looting and staying in the cavern, more Druegar came into the fold and gained the trust of the Silver Hands. They showed the tracking magic item on the dragons necklace, and moved the group into further Druegar territory where everything ended.
